# Spring Boot Learning Journey 

This repository documents my journey in learning and practicing **Spring Boot** backend development using Java.  
I’m focusing on building solid foundations in RESTful API design, CRUD operations, DTO usage, and database integration with PostgreSQL.

## What I've Learned So Far

- ✅ Setting up Spring Boot projects with Maven
- ✅ Creating RESTful APIs using `@RestController`
- ✅ Performing CRUD operations using Spring Data JPA
- ✅ Using DTOs for clean data transfer between layers
- ✅ Connecting and configuring PostgreSQL database
- ✅ Exception handling and validation
- ✅ JWT Security
